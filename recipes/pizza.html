    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pepperoni Pizza is a classic and popular dish made with a crispy crust, rich tomato sauce, melted cheese, and savory pepperoni slices. To prepare it, pizza dough is first rolled out into a round shape and placed on a baking pan. A layer of tomato sauce is spread evenly over the dough, followed by a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese. Pepperoni slices are then placed on top of the cheese, adding a spicy and smoky flavor. The pizza is baked in a hot oven until the crust turns golden brown and the cheese melts and bubbles. Once done, it is sliced and served hot, making it a delicious and comforting meal enjoyed by people of all ages.</p>
